## üöÄ What is Switchblade?

Do you find yourself switching between multiple windows while writing a thesis/research paper or coding a machine learning pipeline? 

Is the constant reaching for the mouse, looking for the window you want taxing your ADHD brain and killing your concentration?

Do you keep copying and pasting back and forth from MS Word/Powerpoint/VS Code to Chat GPT? 

If so, this just might be the app for you. 

Switchblade is a lightweight AutoHotkey-based utility that allows you to use some easy shortcuts to switch between the different programs you're working in for your project. 

With a little practice and muscle memory, you'll forget your mouse exists -- your fingers will fly and your keyboard will clatter like you're a hacker in a movie. "Aaaaaand....I'm in!"

2. Copy the shortcut file.
3. Press **Win+R**.  
4. Type:  shell:startup and press Enter.  
5. Paste the shortcut file into this folder. 

### Method 2: Explorer
1. In File Explorer, create a shortcut to `Switchblade.exe` (or to your `.ahk` if you run that) by right-clicking on the file.   
2. In the address bar, type:  shell:startup and press Enter.  
3. Copy a shortcut to `Switchblade.exe` (or to your `.ahk` if you run that) into this folder.
